Hey, I’m Cyan, a random guy on the internet, and a software engineer. Glad to meet you and I hope we can be good friends!

I enjoy writing code and tweaking things, with passion being my driving force. I’m fascinated by user interface and interaction design. And if you happen to be interested in them, maybe we can have a lot to talk about. I don’t set limits for myself. As long as I can achieve the goal, I’m always willing to learn by doing. Curiosity is also one of my motivations[^](https://durmonski.com/life-advice/curiosity-is-better-than-being-smart/). I love digging into the essence of things and thinking with the first principle.

I’m now working on Mac client development at a “video conference software” company. And before that, I was at ByteDance and Alibaba.

Like many other people, I’m also an Apple fan (or at least was). I love Steve Jobs' product philosophy and Apple's taste in design. Maybe Apple has changed a lot, but its original spirit has always inspired me.

Here are some impressions on me, and I’d like to share with you:

- A minimalist, prefer original over customized.
- Believe that open-source can change the world.
- Native-firstist, hate browsers everywhere[^](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/).
- Console gamer, enjoyed RDR2, Unravel and ACU…
- Used to be active in Zhihu and various tech forums, but has quit.
- Interested in digital archaeology, user of Mountain Lion, Vista and KDE 4.
- ……

To be continued.
