## Quick Q & A

### 1. What is "unixzii"? Is that me?

Yeah, exactly. "unixzii" is one of my very early nickname and derived from a forum and I still use it as my **account name**. To refer to me, please just use "Cyandev".

### 2. When did I start programming?

I guess the true beginning of my programming journal is when I was in primary school. And the first PL I used is ActionScript 2, yes, that's memorable. When I was in junior high school, I started to learn C++, C#. The first application I wrote is a notepad (using a C++ framework called [Qt](https://qt.io)), and it was simple, but I learn a lot from that.

### 3. What is my favorite programming language?

Emmm, that is hard to say. I think I like to use JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift and C++, those PLs do meet my aesthetic and just work for me. And I had ever tried Haskell, Scala and things like that, but I don't think I can make it. To simply sum up, for me, the most common is the most practical.

### 4. Why do I choose to become an iOS developer?

iOS is just an entry point I choose, because I don't like to be a full-stack developer for now, and as an employee, I think I can handle it well. That **does not** mean I can only write iOS apps, actually I write apps for nearly every platforms. I can do it, if it's necessary for me.

### 5. What am I currently doing?

Learning. There is a lot of things to learn to become a "general-purpose" programmer, you know. Of course, before that, there is still a lot of things to learn to be a qualified software developer.
