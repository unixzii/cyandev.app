## Who am I?

My name is Hongyu Yang (aka. Cyandev on social networking), born in 97. I'm a software developer as you see. I generally develop iOS/macOS apps, and that's also my serious job. But I used to be an web frontend developer, I was once involved in several web projects.

Currently I work at Alibaba Inc. and was prior at Tencent and Shimo.

I really care about the user experience and always be passionate in making elegant and comfortable products. Sometimes I seem to be a geek and keep exploring interesting techniques.
